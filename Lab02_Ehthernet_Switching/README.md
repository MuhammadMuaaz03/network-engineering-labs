### Here we are given a basic Network, we see 2 PCS connected with a fast ethernet connection using a straight through cable and 2 switches connected using port 0/1 with a gbps connection with a crossovercable, I am assuming AUTOMDI-X to be disabled
         Lab Objectives: 
            1: Using Pings, I generate network traffic and allow the Switches to the Learn the MAC addresses
               of all the nodes in the network. 
            2: Identifying which MAC address is of which PCS
